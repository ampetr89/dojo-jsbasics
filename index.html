	<h2 id="overview">JavaScript Basics</h2>
	<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#" id="var-dec">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="code">var x;</span></li>
		<li><a href="#" id="var-asn">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JaavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="code">var x = 10;</span></li>
		<li><a href="#" id="data-tp">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are siz data types that are JavaScript primitive: Boolean - <span class="code">true</span> or <span class="code">false;</span>,  <span class="code">null</span> aka nothing; Number -  <span class="code">42</span> or  <span class="code">3.14159;</span> String -  <span class="code">&#34;Coding Dojo Rocks!&#34;;</span> Array - <span class="code">[1, &#39;Coding&#39;, 2, &#39;Dojo&#39;]</span></li>
		<li><a href="#" id="cond">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="code">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="code">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="code">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
		<li><a href="#" id="loop">Loops</a> There are many kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the smae thing: they will repeat an extion some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop! </li>
		<li><a href="#" id="fcn">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again. </li>
